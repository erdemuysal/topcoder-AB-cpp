# Topcoder AB Problem Resolution

### Problem Statement

You are given two s: *N* and *K*. Lun the dog is interested in strings that satisfy the following conditions:

* The string has exactly *N* characters, each of which is either 'A' or 'B'.
* The string _s_ has exactly *K* pairs (_i_, _j_) (0 <= _i_ < _j_ <= *N*-1) such that s[_i_] = 'A' and s[_j_] = 'B'.

If there exists a string that satisfies the conditions, find and return any such string. Otherwise, return an empty string.
